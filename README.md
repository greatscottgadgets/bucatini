# Bucatini: a soft PIPE PHY for FPGA SerDes

**Bucatini** is a noodly gateware layer capable of transforming an FPGA SerDes into a PIPE PHY,
allowing you to use existing e.g. PCI-e or USB3 gateware without an expensive, discrete PHY.
Like its namesake, Bucatini is designed to be a flexible, soft PIPE with a pleasant mouthfeel.

## Status

Bucatini is currently in its very early development, and thus is only partially present. This 
document will be updated once more concrete information is available.
